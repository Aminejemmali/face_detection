# Face Detection System

This project implements a simple face and eye detection system using OpenCV in Python. It uses Haar Cascades to detect faces and eyes in real-time through a webcam feed.

## Installation

Install the required Python packages:

\```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
\```

## Usage

To run the face detection system, execute the following command in the root directory of the project:

\```bash
python face_detection.py
\```

Ensure your webcam is enabled and properly configured as the application uses the default camera device.
