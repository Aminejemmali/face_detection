# Face Detection System

This project implements a simple face and eye detection system using OpenCV in Python. It uses Haar Cascades to detect faces and eyes in real-time through a webcam feed.

## Installation

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage

To run the face detection system, execute the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
python detection.py
```

Ensure your webcam is enabled and properly configured as the application uses the default camera device.

## Phase 1
The project has successfully passed phase 1, including the detection of objects in one camera device.
## Phase 2: Dual Camera Support
Second phase completed, we plan to enhance the system to support simultaneous detection using two camera devices on the same machine. This will allow for more robust face detection in diverse scenarios.
