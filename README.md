# Face Detection System

This project implements a simple face and eye detection system using OpenCV in Python. It uses Haar Cascades to detect faces and eyes in real-time through a webcam feed.

## Features

- Real-time face detection.
- Eye detection within the detected faces.
- Ability to overlay a custom background, blending detected faces and background.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. Additionally, this project depends on the following packages:

- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aminejemmali/face_detection.git
cd face_detection
```bash
## Usage
To run the face detection system, execute the following command in the root directory of the project:

bash
Copy code
python face_detection.py
Ensure your webcam is enabled and properly configured as the application uses the default camera device.
